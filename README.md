# uniswap-front-running-bot
Experimental front running bot. Please fork and add changes and let us make this great.

This project implements a  bot for Ethereum trading. The bot monitors the Ethereum mempool for pending transactions, identifies large buy/sell orders, and attempts to profit from price changes by placing transactions with higher gas fees.

## Overview

The  bot is designed to automate the process of identifying profitable trading opportunities on the Ethereum network, particularly focusing on large trades in Uniswap pools. By monitoring pending transactions and quickly responding to market movements, the bot aims to execute trades that can potentially yield profits.

## Features

- Mempool monitoring using Etherscan API
- Large order identification using Uniswap Subgraph API
- Automated transaction placement with custom gas fees
- Basic risk management through trade size limiting
- Continuous operation with error handling

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Ethereum wallet with sufficient ETH for transactions and gas fees
- Etherscan API key
- Infura Project ID (or other Ethereum node provider)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eth-bot.git
   cd eth-bot
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy the `config.example.py` file to `config.py`:
   ```
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```

2. Edit `config.py` and fill in your personal details:
   - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`: Your Etherscan API key
   - `INFURA_URL`: Your Infura project URL (or other Ethereum node provider)
   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Your Ethereum wallet's private key
   - `UNISWAP_POOL_ADDRESS`: The address of the Uniswap pool you want to monitor
   - `MAX_TRADE_SIZE`: Maximum trade size in ETH
   - `GAS_PRICE`: Gas price for  transactions in Gwei

## Usage

Run the bot using the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The bot will start monitoring the mempool and print information about pending transactions and large orders it identifies. When it detects a potentially profitable opportunity, it will attempt to place a  transaction.

## How It Works

1. **Mempool Monitoring**: The bot continuously queries the Ethereum mempool using the Etherscan API to identify pending transactions.

2. **Large Order Identification**: It uses the Uniswap Subgraph API to find large swap orders that might impact token prices.

3. **Transaction Placement**: When a large order is identified, the bot attempts to place a  transaction with a higher gas fee to ensure it's processed before the large order.

4. **Risk Management**: A basic risk management strategy is implemented by limiting the maximum size of each trade.

5. **Continuous Operation**: The bot runs in an infinite loop, with error handling to ensure it continues operating even if it encounters issues.
